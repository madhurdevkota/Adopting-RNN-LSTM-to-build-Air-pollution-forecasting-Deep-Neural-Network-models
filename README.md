Jupyter Notebook Project: Air Pollution Forecasting Using RNN and LSTM

Introduction

This Jupyter notebook project focuses on building a sophisticated air pollution forecasting model using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The project leverages advanced deep learning techniques to predict air pollution levels from time-series data.
Data Collection and Preprocessing

    Data Loading:
        The project uses air quality data from a CSV file named BE_1_2013-2015_aggregated_timeseries.csv, which includes various air quality metrics recorded over several years.
        Metadata associated with these measurements is loaded from BE_2013-2015_metadata.csv.

    Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
        Initial data exploration is conducted using pandas_profiling to identify constant variables, missing values, and potential outliers in air pollution levels.
        Unnecessary variables, such as those with constant values or redundant information, are identified for removal.

    Data Cleaning:
        The dataset is filtered to include only daily aggregated measurements (P1D).
        Rows with non-standard units of measurement and those with insufficient coverage are removed to maintain data integrity and consistency.
        Data is restructured by setting DatetimeBegin as the index for easier time-series manipulation.

    Handling Missing Data:
        The dataset is resampled daily to ensure uniformity across the time series, filling missing entries using backward fill based on available data.

Model Preparation and Feature Engineering

    Data Normalization:
        Data normalization is performed using MinMaxScaler to scale the air pollution levels between 0 and 1, facilitating more stable training dynamics.

    Time Series Data Preparation:
        A TimeseriesGenerator is employed to create structured input-output pairs from the time series, crucial for training the forecasting models.

Model Development and Training

    Simple RNN Model:
        A simple RNN model with a single RNN layer followed by a dense output layer is constructed and trained. The model uses callbacks for checkpointing and early stopping based on validation loss.

    Simple LSTM Model:
        An LSTM model is designed to overcome the vanishing gradient problem inherent in standard RNNs. This model also utilizes callbacks for efficient training management.

    Stacked LSTM Model:
        A more complex LSTM configuration with multiple layers is developed to capture deeper temporal dependencies and improve model performance.

Model Evaluation and Results

    Each model is evaluated using a separate test dataset to ensure the modelâ€™s ability to generalize beyond the training data. Results are visualized and compared to identify the best-performing model based on prediction accuracy and loss metrics.
